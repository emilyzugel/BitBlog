    <p>Bitcoin is a digital currency. This means that it exists
       only in the virtual world, it does not have a physical version
       like traditional coins and notes. It does not depend on any bank 
       or government to function, it is decentralized.
    </p>
    <h3>Divisibility and quantity limit</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin is divisible. This means that you can divide a single 
        Bitcoin into smaller fractions. The smallest unit is called satoshi,
        which is 0.00000001 BTC. That is, 1 Bitcoin can be divided into 
        100,000,000 satoshis, just as 1 euro can be divided into 100 cents. 
        In addition, Bitcoin has been slated to have a cap of 21 million units. 
        Which helps to avoid the inflation that happens with traditional currencies,
        since governments can print too much.

    <h3>Mining</h3>
    <p>To create a Bitcoin, a process called mining is required. Mining is a type of 
        "competition" between computers trying to solve very difficult mathematical 
        problems. Whoever solves the problem first, wins the reward in Bitcoin. 
        This process is also responsible for verifying transactions on the Bitcoin 
        network.
    </p>
    <h3>The Halving</h3>
    <p>Every 4 years, what we call a halving occurs. The halving is when the reward for 
        mining a Bitcoin block is halved. This means that with each halving, miners receive 
        fewer Bitcoins as a reward. The halving is important because it helps to control the 
        amount of Bitcoins that are created, causing the currency to become scarcer over time.
