    <h3>What are lost bitcoins?</h3>
    <p>Lost bitcoins are coins that, despite still existing on the blockchain, 
        are forever inaccessible due to situations such as the loss of private 
        keys, errors in wallet storage or the death of the owner without sharing 
        access.So, unlike paper money, which can be misplaced, torn or even found 
        on the street (who hasn’t, right? Pure nostalgia!), Bitcoin is digital. 
        That means that it doesn’t take up physical space, so a bitcoin can’t just 
        disappear or end up “lost from sight“.
    </p>
    <p>Bitcoin exists as a record in a digital space. In other words, it is code. 
        It is accessed via private keys, also known as seeds. They function as a 
        password that guarantees ownership and control over the bitcoins associated 
        with a given public address. So when you send your bitcoin to someone else, 
        you’re basically transferring that control. Whoever receives bitcoin needs 
        the private key associated with the public address that received the transaction 
        in order to be able to spend it in the future. Now comes the most important 
        point: if you lose your private key, you also lose access to your bitcoins.
        No, they don’t disappear from the network, but they do become inaccessible, 
        as if they were locked in a digital safe without a key. That’s why it’s more 
        accurate to say that bitcoins don’t simply “get lost“, but become inaccessible 
        forever.
